Hello,

Please note that this is just a temporary project and will be merged with H2.

This project contains a bunch of experimental stuff handling UDP based data, and using queues to process inbound data. It also ups the ante on H2 by leveraging memcache, and by massively more sensibly calculating historical data.

After a process of refactoring, this project will be merged into H3.

Shout if you'd like to get involved.
